### Apprenticeship Program (ING)

#### What is Apprenticeship?
Apprenticeship training is based on alternating periods of training in an educational institution (theoretical training) and in a host company (practical training). The apprenticeship contract is a work contract between an employer and an employee. Its objective is to allow a young person to follow general, theoretical, and practical training to acquire a State diploma or a professional qualification.

At ECE, only apprenticeship contracts are available (not professional training contracts).

The apprenticeship is based on the principle of alternating between theoretical teaching in an apprenticeship training center (CFA) or educational institution and learning the profession with the employer with whom the apprentice has signed their contract.

#### Apprenticeship at ECE
Since 2008, ECE has offered students the opportunity to follow their engineering curriculum through apprenticeship under contract. The school thus responds to a strong demand from companies wishing to train operational engineers at the end of their studies.

The Engineering Curriculum under apprenticeship contract allows students to alternate periods in companies (the apprentice applies the teachings provided at school) and at ECE (the school provides the apprentice with the knowledge necessary for future missions in companies).

The 4 specializations offered by ECE in ING3:
- Cybersecurity & Network Administrator
- DevOps & Cloud Administrator
- Application Developer
- Data & AI Developer

In the 2nd year of the engineering cycle (ING4), apprentices choose their specialization major from the following majors:
- Cybersécurité
- Data & IA
- Digital Transformation & Innovation
- Systèmes Embarqués
- Systèmes d'Energie Nucléaire
- Véhicule Connecté & Autonome

#### Apprenticeship Schedule
The alternation rhythm is adapted to pedagogy and business:
- 1st year (ING3): 24 weeks in companies and 13 weeks of courses in Paris + 15 weeks abroad (INSEEC Campus in London)
- 2nd year (ING4): 38 weeks in companies / 14 weeks in courses
- 3rd year (ING5): 39 weeks in company / 13 weeks in courses

The rhythm varies between 3 weeks of training and 3 to 4 weeks in the company.
These periods will allow students to follow long-term projects in the company and facilitate adaptation.

#### Apprentice Compensation
As an employee, the apprentice is an integral part of the company and is subject to the same rules as other employees. They receive a salary throughout their training and benefit from 5 weeks of leave per year.

The amount of the minimum wage (SMIC) as of January 1, 2020, is €1,539.42. The salary is set according to the age and year of training of the apprentice.

#### Prerequisites for the Apprenticeship Contract
Apprenticeship contracts can be signed at the earliest 2 months before the start of classes.
The apprenticeship contract is a commitment, and every student must be aware of the missions they will be entrusted with before giving their agreement (oral or written). At ECE, they do not accept that any of their initial or alternating students abandon a company that has made them a promise of reception. Signing a contract is a commitment, and it is very difficult to change companies during the contract. ECE is also a decision-maker, and you should not count on that.

#### Support for Eligible Students in Finding a Company
The Corporate Relations department assists students in finding a host company.
To help students find the host company that would allow them to complete their work-study program, several actions are implemented:

First, students are invited to review the presentation of their CV by participating in CV workshops.
The CV is then integrated into a CV Book of apprentices which is sent to all the school's partner companies.

Finally, the Corporate Relations department organizes an Apprenticeship Forum that will be held over two dates. This year, the Apprenticeship Forum will be held on May 14, 2020, and June 2, 2020.

The Apprenticeship Forum aims to bring together a panel of companies to meet, in the form of mini-interviews, all students eligible for apprenticeship (ING3 and ING4).

Students will receive an information email on this subject before the Apprenticeship Forum.

"At ECE, each student freely chooses their path according to their tastes, personal abilities, and professional project."

#### What is an Internship For?
The internship corresponds to a temporary period of placement in a professional environment. Its purpose is to introduce you to the world of work; to acquire professional skills and to implement what you've learned in your training towards obtaining your diploma. This internship will allow you to:
- Discover, understand the functioning of an organization (company, association, local authority, ministry, NGO, etc.)
- Discover or better know a sector of activity
- Experience teamwork
- Refine your professional project
- Identify the type of structure that suits you
- Build a relational network
- Fill the skills and professional experiences section of your CV
- Facilitate the transition from the world of higher education to that of business thanks to this first experience

#### Who Should Look for My Internship?
You! The internship should allow you to gain autonomy, to make you responsible.
The internship service team is nevertheless at your disposal throughout your steps to provide advice and support.

#### Where to Find Your Internship?
Many possibilities are available to you:
- Participate in the ECE Careers Forum which takes place every year in early October
- Consult the job pages of websites of companies that interest you
- Request your network (family, friends, relationships...)
- Contact temp agencies: Manpower, interim Nation, Adecco, Randstad...
- Consult social networks: LinkedIn, Viadeo
- Consult recruitment websites:
  - Job Teaser by Career Center offers
  - Directory of job sites for abroad
- Consult our list of companies that have already hosted interns
- Attend salons and events on youth employment
- See our calendar of forums and salons

#### Where to Do Your Internship?
The internship can be carried out in a company, association, research laboratory, bank, supermarket, local authority, NGO, ministry, etc. in summary, in any professional structure both in France and abroad.
Attention: the ING3 internship is subject to an additional constraint. Indeed, it is required to find a professional structure that is sufficiently important to observe different determined aspects of a company. Also, a workforce of at least 15 employees is required for the validation of the internship request.

#### Is There a Deadline to Find an Internship?
Yes. The periods between which internships must obligatorily take place are communicated to you on your internship booklet.

#### I Found an Internship, What Should I Do Now?
Once you have found a host structure, you must have your internship project validated by the administrative team and your pedagogical referent. This is to ensure that the internship project complies in terms of: dates, duration, weekly hours worked, etc., and that it corresponds well to the pedagogical expectations of your year of study.
Attention, you must absolutely not commit to your host structure without the assurance of the validation of the internship by ECE.

#### How to Validate Your Internship?
To validate your internship project, you will need to go to the ECE students' internship platform: https://convention.omneseducation.com/ and carefully complete a proposal form using a checklist (available on Moodle) that you will have previously had filled out by your host structure. At the end of this process, you will receive by email your internship agreement which will be printed and signed in 3 copies.

#### For What Reasons Can My Internship Be Refused?
This remains very rare. However, an internship may be refused if all conditions are not met, for example:
- the internship is too short
- the internship encroaches on courses
- the host company has too few staff (too few for effective supervision of the intern).
A host company that abuses interns may also constitute grounds for refusal. In addition, a company may be on our blacklist for various reasons.
Furthermore, ECE will refuse any internship in a country considered a risk country. The location of the internship must not appear in the "orange" or "red" zones of the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE) website https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs.

#### What is a Checklist?
The checklist is a form that aims to help you collect all the elements necessary for an internship convention request. First, you will need to give it to your host structure. When this form is returned to you completed by the host company, you will be able to submit, in a second step, your internship proposal on the ECE internship platform https://convention.omneseducation.com/.

#### Where to Find Your Checklist?
The checklist is available on your Moodle.

#### What Should You Do Before Starting Your Internship?
It is mandatory to establish an agreement for any internship in a company or professional structure.

#### What is an Internship Agreement?
An internship agreement is a tripartite contract that involves the following signatories: the student, the company, and the ECE school. This contract specifies the commitments and responsibilities of each. It allows to specify what was decided in advance, that is, everything related to the intern's mission as well as the practical organization of the internship (dates, duration, schedules, etc.) It also indicates the skills to be acquired or developed during this period in the company and how this time fits into the training curriculum.

#### Is the Internship Agreement Mandatory?
Yes. Any period of internship in a professional environment is subject to an internship agreement which must be signed by the 3 parties: student, company, school. It is not possible to do an internship in a professional structure without this agreement. The company would be in irregularity with respect to the Labor Code. Moreover, the student would in no way be protected in case of a work accident or even in case of an accident on the way.

#### Who Signs Your Internship Agreement?
The internship agreement is a tripartite contract, that is, a contract that engages three parties:
- you, the student
- the company and the company tutor
- ECE Paris and the school tutor.
Each party must sign all copies and this, imperatively before the beginning of the internship.

#### Who Issues Your Internship Agreement?
The internship agreement is issued by ECE. However, some host companies may propose internship agreements. In the case where the host company would edit its own agreement, the contract retained would be that proposed by the company in order to minimize conflicts of interest between the 3 parties. Please notify us by email at stages@ece.fr when submitting your internship on the student internship platform.

#### What Are the Processing Times for a School Internship Agreement?
The internship agreement is issued as soon as the missions are validated by your pedagogical referent. It takes 7 days for the edition of the agreement in triple copy. Once the agreement is issued, it cannot be canceled.

#### How to Access Your Internship Agreement?
The internship agreement is created step by step when you submit your internship proposal on your ECE students' internship platform: https://convention.omneseducation.com/ When your internship project is validated at the administrative and pedagogical level, a digital format internship agreement is sent to you by email to your ECE mailbox. This agreement must be printed in 3 copies and signed by each of the parties. One copy will be given to the company, a second to the ECE school, and the last copy will be kept by the student. (Attention: no duplicate will be given in case of loss!)

#### Can You Do an Internship Without an Internship Agreement?
No. It is imperative to have an internship agreement signed by the three parties before the beginning of the internship. This is an absolute prerequisite for the internship. Without this agreement, the student's work accident protection could not be ensured.

#### The Company Offers Me a Fixed-Term Contract or a Temporary Contract, Can I Accept?

I am in ING1, ING2 or ING3: Yes, the internship can be a job in the form of a fixed-term contract or a temporary contract. And, as for the internship convention, you must imperatively submit your job on the ECE student internship platform https://convention.omneseducation.com/ so that your pedagogical manager validates your mission and consequently, the relevance of this job. Don't forget to specify the format of the internship in the corresponding field (at the level of the "description of the internship")

I am in ING4 or ING5: No. A fixed-term contract or a temporary contract cannot be proposed in place of an internship agreement for a cycle M internship. Indeed, the school is not a stakeholder and it will be impossible for it to enforce the evaluation process that must be applied. Moreover, in case of a dispute between the student and the host company, the school will not be able to intervene.

#### My Internship Starts Tomorrow and My Agreement is Being Validated, Can I Start My Internship?
No. You are not authorized to start your internship before the return of your internship agreement signed by the 3 parties.

#### I Want to Do My Internship Abroad, Is It Possible?
Yes. Absolutely. Keep in mind that the modalities will be different, so inform yourself about the conditions of the internship as well as the conditions of entry and stay in your destination country. Experiences abroad are strongly encouraged as they are a real added value on a CV. At ECE, the process to obtain an internship agreement is the same as for internships in France. You must validate your internship project by going to the ECE student internship platform: https://convention.omneseducation.com/
and carefully complete a proposal form using a checklist (available on Moodle) that you will have previously had filled out by your host structure.
It is advisable to start the process as early as possible (6 months before the internship) because depending on the country, the prior administrative procedures can be lengthy.

#### I Want to Do My Internship During My Gap Year, Is It Possible?
No. Can be an intern, any student for whom internships are mandatory since they are part of the training curriculum followed. Also, to be able to sign an internship agreement, the following conditions must be respected:
- the pedagogical volume of teaching of this training curriculum must be at least 200 hours per year of teaching
- have a minimum of 50 hours in person. Thus, no internship agreement will be signed during the gap period. However, you have the possibility to do a gap in a professional environment in the form of a fixed-term contract or in VIE / VIA service.

### Internship Conduct

#### What is the Minimum Duration of the Internship?
For the mandatory internships of your curriculum, the training for each year of study provides for a minimum duration of:

I am in ING1: optional internship, no duration
I am in ING2: 25 continuous working days full-time, i.e., 5 weeks minimum
I am in ING3: 25 continuous working days full-time, i.e., 5 weeks minimum
I am in ING4: 80 continuous working days full-time, i.e., 16 weeks minimum
I am in ING5: 125 continuous working days full-time, i.e., 25 weeks minimum

Attention to public holidays and closures during annual leave of the host company!

#### What is the Maximum Duration of the Internship?
The maximum legal duration of an internship in a professional environment is 6 months in the same host organization and per year of teaching equivalent to a maximum of 924 hours of effective presence in the host organization.
This duration is determined as follows:
7 hours of presence per day
22 days of presence equivalent to 1 month.

The mandatory internships of your ECE curriculum last approximately 5 weeks for ING2 and ING3, and respectively 4 months and 6 months approximately for ING4 and ING5.
However, a student who wishes can perfectly ask in advance to do a longer internship within the legal limit, and to the extent that the internship does not encroach on their course dates.

#### How to Calculate, in Advance, the Number of Working Days of Your Internship?
The site www.joursouvres.fr will help you estimate in advance an end date of internship. For this, you will have to, at the level of the "calculator" tab of the site, set the start date of your internship and indicate the minimum imposed internship duration in working days. The calculator will thus indicate to you a presumed end date of internship taking into account all the public holidays.

Yes. If the company deems it necessary, you may be held to an obligation of discretion, forbidding you to disclose any sensitive information (including in your internship report) concerning their strategies, their products, ongoing or upcoming operations, etc. without prior agreement from the host structure. This commitment will be valid for the duration of the internship and even after the internship. The intern will thus be led to sign a confidentiality request, an NDA, a copy of which is to be returned to the school, at stages@ece.fr.

#### What is an NDA?
An NDA - from the English Non-Disclosure Agreement or Confidentiality Agreement is a contract between two parties that commits one of them (in this case the intern) to keep strictly confidential certain information that the other party (the company) will communicate to them.
A copy of this NDA issued by your company and signed by you must be transmitted to the school, at stages@ece.fr. It must imperatively be integrated into your internship report.

If the internship takes place in one of the States of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) or in Switzerland, you will then have to request your European health insurance card from your social security center. This is nominative, free, and valid for 2 years.
For an internship outside the States of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) or in Switzerland, in the absence of a specific convention, it is strongly advised to subscribe to a complementary mutual/insurance in order to cover the differences in care costs between France and the host country.

Insurance:
It is strongly advised to subscribe to a civil liability insurance valid in the host country (check with your insurance for a possible extension)
You must take out an Assistance contract (repatriation for medical reasons, legal assistance, etc.). This insurance ensures that you are repatriated to France particularly in case of serious problem or hospitalization.

### School Promotion at ECE

Welcome letter.
Throughout the year, many events aim to make the school known and increase its visibility:
this is the principle of "school promotion".
School promotion or the action of promoting one's establishment during the various events organized during the year:
Open Days, salons, webinars, supervision of orals, Competition Days, Campus Days... and who better than YOU
to represent ECE on the ground?

School promotion concerns all promos, Engineers and Bachelors for the 4 campuses (Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux and Rennes) and is mandatory.
However, only ING1 to ING3 and B1 to B3 will be obliged to do school promotion each semester to
be awarded a bonus of up to 0.8 maximum (cf Evaluation System).
As for ING4 and ING5, they are free to get involved or not in the promotion of their school.

FUNCTIONING:
Each student must participate in 1 or more events per SEMESTER in order to be awarded a bonus of up to 0.8.
Additional bonuses may also be awarded (subject to the appreciation of the organizers) depending
on the type of event, the quality of involvement or the time of participation (cf Evaluation System).
All students must follow a theoretical and practical training in the form of a webinar followed by a
immediate test: what is school promotion? how to register? what behavior to adopt?
what are the different admission routes?
This training, mandatory, will take place at the end of September. An email will be sent to you on this subject to
confirm the dates. We strongly recommend that you monitor your student mailbox (@edu.ece.fr).
School promotion is a true moment of sharing, exchanges and meetings. It is also an excellent
way to learn to strengthen or develop your relational and observation skills.
